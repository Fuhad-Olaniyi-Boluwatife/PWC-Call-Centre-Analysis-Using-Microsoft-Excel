# PWC Call centre Customer Care
## Introduction

In today’s world, good customer service is crucial for any business. It shapes how people see a company, builds loyalty, and keeps customers happy. That’s why improving customer support isn’t just about internal operations—it affects everyone who interacts with the business.

As part of a PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program through Forage, I worked on a Call Centre Trends Analysis project. Using real data, I analysed key metrics like:

- Calls answered, unanswered, resolved and unresolved, etc.

- Call duration and resolution rates

- Agent performance

- Customer satisfaction and Customer attended to per agent, etc.


I created an interactive Excel dashboard with filters, charts, and summaries to track monthly performance and agent productivity. This involved cleaning data, using Excel functions, and organising information clearly. The goal was to find ways to improve call centre efficiency and enhance customer experience.

## Problem Statement

This project provides clear insights into customer service operations to help improve call centre performance. Here's what we track:

- **Overall Performance Snapshot** – A quick summary of call volume, agent activity, and customer behaviour to see how the call centre is doing as a whole.
- **Individual Agent Performance** – Tracks each agent’s stats, including call resolution rates and answered vs. missed calls, with filters to check performance by time of day (morning/afternoon/evening).
- **Call Trends Over Time** – Identifies patterns like busiest days of the week or month to help with staffing and resource planning.
- **Customer Problems & Solutions** – Lists common issues customers face and shows how many were resolved, helping measure how well agents handle problems.
- **Core Call Centre Metrics** – Key numbers like total calls, answered/missed calls, and resolved/unresolved issues to track overall efficiency.
- **Service Quality & Efficiency** – Measures like average call time, speed of answering, customer ratings (if available), and how many customers each agent helps per month.
