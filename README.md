# PWC Call centre Customer Care
## Introduction

In today’s world, good customer service is crucial for any business. It shapes how people see a company, builds loyalty, and keeps customers happy. That’s why improving customer support isn’t just about internal operations—it affects everyone who interacts with the business.

As part of a PwC job simulation (hosted by Forage), I worked on a Call Center Trends Analysis project. Using real data, I analyzed key metrics like:

- Calls answered vs. rejected

- Call duration and resolution rates

- Agent performance

- Customer satisfaction


I created an interactive Excel dashboard with filters, charts, and summaries to track monthly performance and agent productivity. This involved cleaning data, using Excel functions, and organizing information clearly. The goal was to find ways to improve call center efficiency and enhance customer experience.
